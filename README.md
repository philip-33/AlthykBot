# AlthykBot
Discord bot for FFXIV

This Discord bot was designed as an assistant for FFXIV. It currently has the following commands:

?wiki (search terms)
The bot will search for the exact term on ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com. If found, it will post the link directly to the
content in the channel. If the search term is not found, it will post a duckduckgo.com search link for (search terms) instead.

Planned:   
?x (search terms)
find (search terms) on xivdb and post a link to the database.

?timers (optional terms)
vom a list of timers or a specific timer, possibly reset info

?vid (dungeon name)
posts a youtube link to a dungeon guide, favoring mizzteq over mr happy, but posting mr. happy's vid if M.A. doesn't have one.
